# results folder

This directory contains the performance of different models built throughout different stages of development.
These files names start with the model used, such as `catboost_train_results.csv`, and contain metrics such as MAE values.

The [predicted_data.zip]('predicted_data.zip') contains the predictions output from the pipeline, which will be overwritten anytime a new prediction is generated through the pipeline.

`report_figures` folder contains the generated figures included in the final report.
