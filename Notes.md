- we don't want to group by playgrounds because we don't consider that some playgrounds are very similar to other playgrounds.
- create a probabilistic distribution using quantile regression and then take the mean/median of the distribution
- fit a model in the square of the residual, and we'll end up getting the variance of the predictions.

- beta distribution assumption would maybe make a difference? 

- Objective for next week
    - start writting the report (include what we tried, the outputs we are looking for, what we found, the decision making process,...)
    - considering what the pipeline should look like
    - come to Vincenzo with 'what defines our data product' and what component should Vincenzo focus on when he is going to grade the project.
