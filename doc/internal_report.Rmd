## Introduction and purpose

- Describe the UBC MDS program and the capstone project
- Explain the project objective and how it aligns with the needs of the organization
- Describe the aim of the report: help individuals navigate our GitHub repository, summarize our findings, report performance of selected models, provide suggestions on how to move forward 

## Description of the data

- _Should these visualizations be made using the old dataset or the new one?_
- Discuss notable findings that influenced modeling decisions
- Describe the distribution of the target variable (include plot)
- Demonstrate the data sparsity (include plot)
  - Which columns contain mostly zeros?
- Illustrate the prevalence of missing values in the explanatory variables (include plot)
- Visualize the presence of missing values in the target variable (include plot)
  - Across the playgrounds
  - Across the months (this will justify why we excluded January 2018 from our analysis)
    - Other seasonal patterns worth mentioning
- Mention duplication of information sources
  - "Sex by Marital Status", "Sex by Age", "Sex by School Enrollment"
  - Column A is the sum of columns B, C and D
- Exemplify that some columns are in fact linear transformations of other columns
  - OSMnx columns: proportions versus counts - one is just a normalized version of the other 

## Rationale behind the output

- Describe what kinds of outputs were considered
  - We considered building a model that outputs either a confidence interval or probability distribution
  - Since the distribution of the target variable is skewed, we thought that these kinds of estimates would be more robust than a single-value prediction
- Explain we choice we ultimately made


## Rationale behind the data split

## Analysis with old dataset

- Data
- Preprocessing
- Modeling

## Analysis with new dataset

- Data 
- Preprocessing
- Modeling 

## Final product

- Link to README with usage instructions
- Description of selected models (hyperparameters)
- Rationale behind why models that predict the median session counts were included

## Potential improvements

## Conclusion

- Reexplain how these findings add value to the organization
