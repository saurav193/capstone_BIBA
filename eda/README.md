# eda folder

This folder contains the explanatory data analysis we realized on the first dataset that was given to us. 
- The files containing `eda` take care of analysing a part of the data (we decided to split the data in 4)
- The notebook `figures_report` generates the figures for the final report
- The `nan_values_study` notebook focuses on the study of missing data in some features.
