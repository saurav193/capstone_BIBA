# Using Machine Learning to Predict Playground Usage Across the U.S.

A capstone project for the UBC Master of Data Science program

Authors: Saurav Chowdhury, Sirine Chahma, Reiko Okamoto, Tani Barasch

## Introduction
Biba creates a mobile games experience that incorporates outdoor play to get children active. Integrating data collected through their app with third-party data, we built a data analysis pipeline and populated a GitHub repository with scripts and well-annotated Jupyter notebook files. We hope that our models and supplemental write-ups will provide useful information to Biba and subsequently playground owners and managers, guiding them through the decision-making process surrounding community play spaces.

## Usage

### To execute each script independently, run these commands in the following order:

#### Split the data
```python src/01_split_data.py --in_path=data/playground_stats.csv --out_path=data```

#### Preprocess the data
```python src/02_preprocessing.py --test=data/test_data.zip --train=data/train_data.zip```

#### Fit and save a `GradientBoostingRegressor`
```python src/03_gbr_model.py --train=data/processed_train.zip --test=data/processed_test.zip --model_path=src/joblib/ --out_path=results/```

#### Fit and save a `CatBoostRegressor`
```python src/04_catboost_model.py --train=data/processed_train.zip --test=data/processed_test.zip --model_path=src/joblib --out_path=results/```

#### Fit and save a `LGBMRegressor`
```python src/05_lgbm_model.py --train=data/processed_train.zip --test=data/processed_test.zip --model_path=src/joblib/ --out_path=results/```

#### Render the RMarkdown report
```Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown); render('doc/internal_report.Rmd', output_format = 'github_document')"```

### To automate script execution using the Makefile:

**Warning**: if the dataset being used doesn't have the same features in the same order as the one that was used for training, this may throw an error. When running the Makefile with such dataset, a warning will appear. 

To generate the the report using the Makefile: 
1. Make sure that the data you want to use to train the models is saved in the `/data` repository, with the name `playground_stats.csv`. 
2. Enter the virtual environment (`pipenv install`,  `pipenv shell`) 
3. In the command line, run `make report` from the root of the repository.
4. Outside of the virtual environment, execute the command to render the RMarkdown report (see above).
4. The report will be generated in the `doc` folder.

To predict `unacast_session_count` from the trained models, using the Makefile:
1. Make sure that the data you want to use to train the models is saved in the `/data` repository, with the name `playground_stats.csv`. 
2. Make sure that the data you want to predict on is in the `/data` repository, with the name `X_pred.zip`. This file can or can not contain the target variable as one of its features.
3. Enter the virtual environment.
3. In the command line, run `make predict` from the root of the repository.
4. A `.csv` file will be generated in the `report` folder. Non-negative predictions from the three models are added as new columns to the input data.

To clear all outputs generated by the Makefiles:
- Run `make clear` in the command line from the root of the repository.
