# Timeline 5

## Week 6 objectives
- start writting the report (include what we tried, the outputs we are looking for, what we found, the decision making process,...)
- considering what the pipeline should look like
- come to Vincenzo with 'what defines our data product' and what component should Vincenzo focus on when he is going to grade the project. 

## Monday, June 8th meeting:
- we don't want to group by playgrounds because we don't consider that some playgrounds are very similar to other playgrounds.
- idea : create a probabilistic distribution using quantile regression and then take the mean/median of the distribution
- if we fit a model in the square of the residual, we'll end up getting the variance of the predictions.

- beta distribution assumption would maybe make a difference?
