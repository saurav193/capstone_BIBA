CAPSTONE Machine Learning

# Executive Summary
We will work with data collected through gameplay and from third-party sources to create models that infer the number of play sessions at a particular playground in a given month. We hope that our model will provide reliable information to playground owners and managers and guide them through the decision-making process surrounding community play spaces.
