# `eda` directory

This folder contains the exploratory data analysis we performed on the first dataset that was given to us (`playground_stats.csv` on Google Drive). 
- The files containing `eda` take care of analysing a part of the data (we decided to split the data in 4)
- The notebook `figures_report` generates the figures for the final report
- The `nan_values_study` notebook focuses on the study of missing data in some features and in the target variable.
